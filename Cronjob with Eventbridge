1️⃣ Create a Scheduled Event Rule in EventBridge

AWS EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) allows you to trigger the Lambda function on a cron schedule.
Steps:

    Go to AWS EventBridge
        1.Open the AWS Management Console
        2.Navigate to EventBridge
        3.Click Rules → Create Rule

    Set a Name & Description
        4.Name: DeleteUnusedSnapshots
        5.Description: Triggers Lambda to delete unused EBS snapshots.

    Define the Schedule
        6.Choose Schedule
        7.Select Cron expression
        8.Enter a cron schedule (see below)

Example Cron Expressions
Schedule	Cron Expression
Every day at 12 AM UTC	0 0 * * ? *
Every 6 hours	0 */6 * * ? *
Every Sunday at 2 AM UTC	0 2 ? * 7 *

    Choose the Lambda Target
        9.Under Target, select Lambda function
        10.Choose your Lambda function

    Create the Rule
        11.Click Create

2️⃣ Modify IAM Permissions (if needed)

Ensure your Lambda IAM role has permissions to manage snapshots. Attach this policy to the Lambda's IAM role:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
